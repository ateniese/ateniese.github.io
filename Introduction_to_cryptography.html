    <h1>CS487/CS587: Introduction to Cryptography (Spring 2025)</h1>
    <h2>Professor: <a href="https://ateniese.github.io">Giuseppe Ateniese</a> (<a href="mailto:ateniese@gmu.edu">ateniese@gmu.edu</a>)</h2>
    <p>Office hours: Wednesday 4:30pm - 5:30pm (Zoom)</p>

    <p class="section-title">Description:</p>
    <p>This course presents a rigorous, theory-focused exploration of modern cryptography, grounded in the comprehensive academic framework provided by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html">Katz and Lindell's textbook</a>. We will engage deeply with the theoretical underpinnings of cryptographic systems, emphasizing the mathematical proofs and theoretical constructs that form the backbone of secure communication.</p>
    <p>Students will explore symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, key distribution and management systems, hash functions, digital signatures, and more, with a particular emphasis on the formal definitions and proofs of security that underlie these concepts. The course aims to develop a profound theoretical understanding and analytical approach to cryptography, preparing students for advanced academic research or careers where a deep, foundational knowledge of cryptographic theory is essential.</p>
    <p class="note">We will use Blackboard for Q&As, course materials, and assignments.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Scheduled Meeting Times:</p>
    <p>Tuesday 4:30pm - 7:10pm, Location: Horizon 2008</p>

    <p class="section-title">Reading Material:</p>
    <p>The primary textbook, which is required for this course, is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html">Introduction to Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell, Third Edition</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alternative readings include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://toc.cryptobook.us">A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography by Dan Boneh, Victor Shoup</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Note: This course requires strong skills in discrete mathematics, covering areas like probability, modular arithmetic, group theory, and number theory, essential for understanding complex cryptographic concepts and mathematical proofs.</p>
    <p class="note">In CS 587, graduate students are required to tackle an additional problem in most assignments and to study supplementary material independently.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Grading:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>50% Assignments</li>
        <li>40% Final</li>
        <li>10% Participation</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="section-title">Ethics:</p>
    <p>Students must adhere to the <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">GMU Honor Code</a> and the <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/">CS Department Honor Code</a>.</p>
