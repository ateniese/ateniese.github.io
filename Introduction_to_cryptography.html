            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This course presents a rigorous, theory-focused exploration of modern cryptography,
                grounded in the comprehensive academic framework provided by 
                <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html">Katz and Lindell's textbook</a>. We will engage deeply with 
                the theoretical underpinnings of cryptographic systems, emphasizing the mathematical proofs and theoretical constructs 
                that form the backbone of secure communication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students will explore symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, key distribution and management systems, hash functions, 
                digital signatures, and more, with a particular emphasis on the formal definitions and proofs of security that underlie 
                these concepts. The course aims to develop a profound theoretical understanding and analytical approach to cryptography, 
                preparing students for advanced academic research or careers where a deep, foundational knowledge of cryptographic theory 
                is essential.

            <h3>Reading Material</h3>
            <p>The primary textbook, which is required for this course, is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html">Introduction to Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell, Third Edition</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://toc.cryptobook.us">A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography by Dan Boneh, Victor Shoup</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note: This course requires strong skills in discrete mathematics, covering areas like probability, modular arithmetic, 
                group theory, and number theory, essential for understanding complex cryptographic concepts and mathematical proofs.
